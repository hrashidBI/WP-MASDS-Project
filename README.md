## Project Description
The lighting industry plays an important role in shaping modern society, providing illumination for residential, commercial, and industrial spaces. With an increasing demand for energy-efficient lighting solutions and the rapid pace of technological advancement, accurate sales forecasting has become critical for lighting manufacturers and distributors to optimize inventory management, production planning, and marketing strategies. However, traditional forecasting methods often fall short of capturing the complex dynamics of the lighting market.

In this project titled "Enlight AI: Predictive Modeling for Sales Forecasting in the Lighting Industry", we aim to leverage the power of artificial intelligence and predictive modeling techniques to develop accurate and reliable sales forecasting models for the lighting industry. By using historical sales data along with other relevant variables such as economic indicators, seasonality, and product characteristics, we aim to increase the accuracy and efficiency of sales forecasting.

The primary objective of this project is to explore and compare different predictive modeling techniques, namely Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting, and ARIMA, to determine their effectiveness in forecasting lighting sales. We will use a comprehensive approach that involves data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation to ensure robust and reliable results.

Through this project, we aim to address several research questions, including the identification of key factors affecting lighting sales, the evaluation of various predictive modeling techniques, and the evaluation of their effectiveness in accurately forecasting sales. Additionally, we aim to provide insight into the strengths and limitations of each model, along with recommendations for industry practitioners on how to use these models to improve their sales forecasting processes.

The report is structured into several chapters starting with an overview of the lighting industry in Bangladesh, followed by a literature review highlighting the existing methods and challenges of sales forecasting. The research objectives are defined, and the report outline is presented to provide a clear framework for the study. We then explore the Methods, Data Analysis, and Results chapters, where we analyze the exploratory data and present the results from the classification models.

The report concludes with a comprehensive discussion of findings, implications, and recommendations for industry practitioners. Additionally, we outline potential areas for future work, highlighting the need for ongoing research and development in sales forecasting models for the lighting industry.

Overall, the "Enlight AI: Predictive Modeling for Sales Forecasting in the Lighting Industry" project aims to bridge the gap between traditional forecasting methods and the growing demand for accurate and efficient sales forecasting. By leveraging advanced predictive modeling techniques, we strive to empower lighting industry stakeholders with actionable insights that can drive business growth and success in an increasingly competitive market.
